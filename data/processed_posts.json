This collaboration enabled us to map affected areas and generate critical insights to aid recovery efforts. These maps have been shared with organizations on the ground to assist in damage assessments and response planning.\n\nKey Findings from Los Angeles Imagery Analysis:\n\n17,835 buildings analyzed:\n\n6,251 are obscured by clouds, shadow, or smoke.\n9,229 are likely unaffected (as of 1/8, 2:21 PM PT).\n2,355 are likely affected by the fires.\n\nWe acknowledge that these fires are ongoing, and the presence of smoke and other obstructions may result in additional impacted buildings that are not yet detectable.\n\nThis analysis represents a portion of the Palisades fire; other fires in the region are not included in this assessment. While these insights offer a valuable initial overview, they remain preliminary and require on-the-ground verification for a comprehensive understanding of the damage.\n\nThe AI for Good Lab remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting affected communities during this challenging time. \n\nIf your organization would benefit from access to the underlying data in this report, please reach out to me. We are committed to sharing this information to support ongoing recovery efforts.\n\nExplore the data through this interactive visualizer:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://lnkd.in/g6swWfh6",

The rise of the consumer web followed and nothing would be the same.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2005, Digg,\u00a0Delicious,\u00a0Flickr, and YouTube introduced applications that enabled everyday users to share digitized links, images, and videos. The rise of social media platforms followed and nothing would be the same.\n\nWith recent innovations in AI, it appears we're now on the cusp of a third inflection point.\n\nIn 2022, Open AI introduced DALL-E 2, enabling everyday users to harness the power of AI to generate images.\n\nThe rise of AI is certainly not a new theme. It's been the subject of science fiction for decades, and over the last few years, understanding its implications and investing in its application have ranked among the top priorities for many companies in Tech and beyond.\n\nThis intense scrutiny on AI is why I've been struck by how surprised some of the industry's top technologists, executives, and investors have been over recent advances in the state of the art and its growing accessibility -- GPT 1, 2, 3, Dall-E 2, and Stable Diffusion just to name a few.\n\nWhat's even more stunning is the stuff that hasn't launched yet, but soon will. The rise of AI generated text, images, audio and video will follow and nothing will be the same.\n\nIf you thought the consumer web and social media were disruptive, you ain't seen nothing yet.",

        "description": "Congrats, Dylan! It's nothing short of extraordinary to see what you and the team have accomplished over the last ten years. \n\nFrom the moment you started as a LinkedIn intern and conceived of the idea for LinkedIn for Good, it was clear you were an unusual talent (shout out to Tim O'Reilly and DJ Patil for recognizing your ability so early on). As much as we were hoping you'd join the company post-graduation, we all knew you were destined to be a game-changing entrepreneur. \n\nUnsurprisingly, over the last decade of working together, you have set the bar in terms of defining the kind of visionary founder, world-class executive, and industry transforming start-up I aspire to support as an investor and coach. Thank you, Dylan. Couldn't be more excited to watch where you take the company and what you accomplish from here!",
