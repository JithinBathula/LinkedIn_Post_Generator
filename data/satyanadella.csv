In collaboration with Planet Labs, we leveraged our damage assessment AI models on high-resolution SkySat satellite imagery provided by Planet. This collaboration enabled us to map affected areas and generate critical insights to aid recovery efforts. These maps have been shared with organizations on the ground to assist in damage assessments and response planning.

Key Findings from Los Angeles Imagery Analysis:

17,835 buildings analyzed:

6,251 are obscured by clouds, shadow, or smoke.
9,229 are likely unaffected (as of 1/8, 2:21 PM PT).
2,355 are likely affected by the fires.

We acknowledge that these fires are ongoing, and the presence of smoke and other obstructions may result in additional impacted buildings that are not yet detectable.

This analysis represents a portion of the Palisades fire; other fires in the region are not included in this assessment. While these insights offer a valuable initial overview, they remain preliminary and require on-the-ground verification for a comprehensive understanding of the damage.

The AI for Good Lab remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting affected communities during this challenging time. 

If your organization would benefit from access to the underlying data in this report, please reach out to me. We are committed to sharing this information to support ongoing recovery efforts.
