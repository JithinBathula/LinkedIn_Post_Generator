As futuristic as the innovations seemed when the ads were first released, many would go on to become mainstream within the next two decades. 

Have seen a number of videos in the last few years focusing on the specific application of new technologies, e.g., AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, drones/flying taxis, robotics, etc., and we're all familiar with classic sci-fi films focused on an increasingly AI driven future. 

However, curious if anyone has seen anything produced recently comparable to the AT&T ads depicting what a future leveraging all of these technologies might look like 20-30 years from now?",3,"",731,105,142,false,"Jeff Weiner","Executive Chairman at LinkedIn / Founding Partner Next Play Ventures","https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08"

In 1993, Mosaic launched its browser, providing an interface that enabled everyday users to consume digitized content. The rise of the consumer web followed and nothing would be the same.

Between 2003 and 2005, Digg, Delicious, Flickr, and YouTube introduced applications that enabled everyday users to share digitized links, images, and videos. The rise of social media platforms followed and nothing would be the same.

With recent innovations in AI, it appears we're now on the cusp of a third inflection point.

In 2022, Open AI introduced DALL-E 2, enabling everyday users to harness the power of AI to generate images.

The rise of AI is certainly not a new theme. It's been the subject of science fiction for decades, and over the last few years, understanding its implications and investing in its application have ranked among the top priorities for many companies in Tech and beyond.

This intense scrutiny on AI is why I've been struck by how surprised some of the industry's top technologists, executives, and investors have been over recent advances in the state of the art and its growing accessibility -- GPT 1, 2, 3, Dall-E 2, and Stable Diffusion just to name a few.

What's even more stunning is the stuff that hasn't launched yet, but soon will. The rise of AI generated text, images, audio and video will follow and nothing will be the same.

If you thought the consumer web and social media were disruptive, you ain't seen nothing yet.",3,"",1960,160,138,false,"Jeff Weiner","Executive Chairman at LinkedIn / Founding Partner Next Play Ventures","https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08"

From the moment you started as a LinkedIn intern and conceived of the idea for LinkedIn for Good, it was clear you were an unusual talent (shout out to Tim O'Reilly and DJ Patil for recognizing your ability so early on). As much as we were hoping you'd join the company post-graduation, we all knew you were destined to be a game-changing entrepreneur. 

Unsurprisingly, over the last decade of working together, you have set the bar in terms of defining the kind of visionary founder, world-class executive, and industry transforming start-up I aspire to support as an investor and coach.
